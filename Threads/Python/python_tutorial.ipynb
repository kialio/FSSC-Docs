    "The python likelihood tools are a very powerful set of analysis tools that expand upon the command line tools provided with the Fermi Science Tools package. Not only can you perform all of the same likelihood analysis with the python tools that you can with the standard command line tools but you can directly access all of the model parameters.  You can more easily script a standard analysis like light curve generation.  There are also a few things built into the python tools that are not available from the command line like the calculation of upper limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many [user contributed packages](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/user/) built upon the python backbone of the Science Tools and we are going to highlight and use a few of them in this tutorial like likeSED, make3FGLxml, and the LATAnalysisScripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample analysis is based on the PG 1553+113 analysis performed by the LAT team and described in [Abdo, A. A. et al. 2010, ApJ, 708, 1310](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...708.1310A). At certain points we will refer to this article as well as the [Cicerone](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/). After you complete this tutorial you should be able to reproduce all of the data analysis performed in this publication including generating a spectrum (individual bins and a butterfly plot) and produce a light curve with the python tools.  This tutorial assumes you have the most recent [ScienceTools](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/) installed. We will also make significant use of python, so you might want to familiarize yourself with python (there's a beginner's guide at http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide. This tutorial also assumes that you've gone through the non-python based [unbinned likelihood](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/likelihood_tutorial.html) thread. This tutorial should take approximately 8 hours to complete (depending on your computer's speed) if you do everything but there are some steps you can skip along the way which shave off about 4 hours of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This tutorial is generated from a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/kialio/FSSC-Docs/blob/master/Threads/Python/python_tutorial.ipynb) which you can download and run yourself (the prefereed method). You can also run individual commands listed on this page.  If you do that, be aware that some commands must be executed in an ipython/jupyter environment."

    "Which brings up the help documentation for that module (type 'x' to exit).  The python object for gtselect is called filter and we first need to set all of it's options. This is very similar to calling gtselect form the command line and inputting all of the variables interactively. It might not seem that convenient to do it this way but it's really nice once you start building up scripts (see [Building a Light Curve](#lightcurve)) and reading back options and such. For example, towards the end of this thread, we'll want to generate a light curve and we'll have to run the likelihood analysis for each datapoint. It'll be much easier to do all of this within python and change the tmin and tmax in an iterative fashion. Note that these python objects are just wrappers for the standalone tools so if you want any information on their options, see the corresponding [documentation](/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/references.html) for the standalone tool."
